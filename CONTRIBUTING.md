## 🚀 Getting Started

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and Clone**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/anything.git
cd anything
```

2. **Create Virtual Environment**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```

4. **Set Environment Variables**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-test-api-key"
export ANYTHING_DEBUG=1
```

5. **Run Tests**

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
python -m pytest --cov=anything
```

## 🏗️ Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/amazing-new-feature

# Create bugfix branch  
git checkout -b fix/critical-bug-fix

# Create documentation branch
git checkout -b docs/improve-readme
```

### Code Standards

#### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 guidelines
- Use type hints consistently
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use meaningful variable names

#### Code Quality

```python
# Good: Descriptive and clear
def generate_fibonacci_sequence(count: int) -> list[int]:
    """Generate Fibonacci sequence with specified count."""


# Bad: Unclear intent
def gen_fib(n):
    pass
```

#### Documentation

- All public functions must have docstrings
- Use Google-style docstring format
- Include type information and examples

```python
def generate_function(self, func_name: str, args: tuple, kwargs: dict) -> Callable:
    """Generate function implementation using AI.
    
    Args:
        func_name: Name of the function to generate
        args: Positional arguments with their types
        kwargs: Keyword arguments with their types
        
    Returns:
        Generated function implementation
        
    Raises:
        OpenAIError: If AI generation fails
        
    Example:
        >>> generator = Anything()
        >>> func = generator.generate_function("add", (1, 2), {})
        >>> result = func(1, 2)
        3
    """
```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Structure

```

├── unit/
│   ├── test_anything.py
│   ├── test_lazy_anything.py
│   └── test_everything.py
├── integration/
│   ├── test_caching.py
│   └── test_context_sharing.py
└── examples/
    ├── test_fibonacci.py
    └── test_performance.py
```

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from anything import Everything


class TestEverything:
    def setup_method(self):
        self.everything = Everything(
            api_key="test-key",
            cache_dir=Path("./test_cache")
        )

    def test_function_generation(self):
        """Test basic function generation."""
        result = self.everything.add_numbers(5, 3)
        assert result == 8

    def test_caching_behavior(self):
        """Test that functions are cached properly."""
        # First call generates
        result1 = self.everything.multiply(4, 5)

        # Second call uses cache
        result2 = self.everything.multiply(4, 5)

        assert result1 == result2 == 20
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
pytest

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_anything.py

# With coverage
pytest --cov=anything --cov-report=html

# Performance tests
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-only
```

## 🎨 Design Principles

### Core Philosophy

1. **Intent Over Implementation**: Focus on what, not how
2. **Contextual Intelligence**: Functions should understand each other
3. **Developer Experience**: Make complex things simple
4. **Performance**: Fast generation and execution
5. **Reliability**: Consistent, predictable behavior

### Architecture Guidelines

- **Modular Design**: Each component has single responsibility
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new generators and patterns
- **Caching Strategy**: Intelligent caching for performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and clear errors

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### AI Safety

- Validate AI-generated code before execution
- Implement sandboxing for untrusted code
- Monitor for malicious pattern generation
- Rate limiting for API calls

### Data Privacy

- Never log API keys or secrets
- Sanitize user inputs in logs
- Respect user privacy in examples
- Secure cache file permissions

## 🌍 Community Guidelines

### Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them learn
- Provide constructive feedback
- Focus on the code, not the person
